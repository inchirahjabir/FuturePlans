# FuturePlans

Welcome to FuturePlans, a career planning website that provides students with an intuitive and user-friendly platform to explore graduate school and employment opportunities.

Technologies
-------------

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

- MySQL

The website was built using Visual Studio Code, resulting in a sleek and modern design that caters to the needs of the user.

Features
---------

FuturePlans offers a dynamic filtering system that allows users to search for specific graduate programs or jobs using various filters. This ensures that users find the perfect fit for their aspirations and skills.

To enhance user experience, I have incorporated a comprehensive database management system using MySQL to store user data. Additionally, I have implemented secure user account features that allow users to register, log in, and log out with ease.

To help users make informed decisions, FuturePlans provides links to additional information about each job or program. This enhances their understanding of potential opportunities and enables them to make better decisions for their future.

I am continuously working on improving FuturePlans to better serve our users. Some of the future enhancements include:

- Adding more filters to the dynamic filtering system
- Expanding the database to include more graduate programs and job opportunities
- Incorporating a feature to enable users to save their preferred programs and jobs
- Implementing a chatbot to help users with their queries
